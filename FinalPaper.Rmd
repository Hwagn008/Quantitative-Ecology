Introduction:

An endogenous circadian clock can interact with a light-dark cycle to determine the behavioral rhythm expression at the physiological, molecular, and behavioral levels. In mosquitoes, there exist multiple chronobiology studies where circadian phenotypes have been shown to influence activities like sugar feeding, blood feeding, oviposition, and locomotor activity (Edman 1977; Meireles-Filho & Kyriacou et al. 2013; Gatton et al. 2013 ). The detoxification of oxidative stress is another process that has been found in Ae. aegypti to be regulated by the circadian clock, and this process is often caused by insecticide usage, like the use of pyrethroids (Yang et al. 2010). The association in Ae. aegypti made between the CYP9M9 detoxification gene and the clock gene period moreover show elevated expression during the dusk period, where there is typically increased activity, host-seeking, and oviposition (Yang et al. 2010). Pyrethroids are relevant due to the local application of this insecticide by Miami-Dade County (Miami Dade Mosquito Control). Although morphological and physiological resistance pathways such as metabolic resistance, target site modifications, and cuticle thickness are typically studied (Vontas et al. 2012), understanding possible behavioral resistance, like a circadian-regulated behavioral phenotype in this organism, has not yet been well-studied. Behavioral resistance has been defined as a modification of vector behavior that allows for insecticide avoidance, allowing a mosquito to escape without harm (Carrasco et al. 2019). This study will compare the locomotor activity of second-generation wild-caught Ae. aegypti mosquitoes with that of a susceptible laboratory strain of Ae. aegypti, “Orlando”. This strain was chosen as reference to what the mosquito’s conserved circadian rhythm would look like since it is not insecticide resistant and has not been exposed to any insecticide chemicals that may affect behavior since its laboratory establishment (Kuno 2010).

Methods:

Subsequent generations of field-collected mosquito lines and Orlando control were hatched and allowed to mate for three days after eclosure in the BugDorm. After the three day period, Orlando and field-caught female mosquitoes were transferred into smaller, clear containers where they were entrained for two days in a 14:10 Light:Dark cycle at 27º C in a Tritech DigiTherm® incubator. Mosquitoes from the batches that were previously entrained in the incubators were moved as individuals into the glass tubes of the TriKinetics Locomotor Activity Monitor (LAM) with a cotton ball on each side, one dry and one soaked in 10% sucrose. The LAM monitor records locomotor activity through the use of an infrared beam-break assay which is located in the middle of the monitor measuring movement when interrupted by a passing mosquito. The LAM ran for 3 days. The data was used to create a timeseries through the use of ARIMA model. The model's goal for the purposes of this study is to better understand circadian rhythm trends in laboratory versus wild mosquitoes and also to test if it is possible to predict future peaks in activity movement in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes by examining the differences between values in the series instead of through actual values. In order to prepare for building an ARIMA model, the time series is separated into the seasonal, trend and irregular components to understand it’s behavior. The Seasonal component would refer to fluctuations in the data related to circadian rhythm cycles. The time series will also be tested for stationarity. This is because ARIMA uses previous lags of series to model its behavior and modeling a stable series with consistent properties involves less uncertainty. Autocorrelation plots will also be made as a useful visual tool in determining whether a series is stationary. ACF plots display correlation between a series and its lags. Partial autocorrelation plots (PACF) will display correlation between a variable and its lags that is not explained by previous lags. 

Results:

![Initial Visualization](VisualizeFP.jpeg)
Graph1: Orlando female non-gravid mosquito locomotor activity throughout the period of four days. The average counts were collected every ten minutes. The time period has been set to encompass a full 24 hour day.

![Identifying and Replacing Outliers](RemoveOutliersFP.jpeg)
Graph2: Removal of any outliers from Graph1 (Orlando time series) that could bias the model by skewing statistical summaries.

Graph3: This deconstruction of the time series of Graph1 (Orlando time series) separates the time series into the seasonal, trend and irregular components. The Seasonal component refers to fluctuations in the data related to daily Light:Dark cycles. Trend component is the overall pattern of the series. It consists of decreasing or increasing patterns that are not seasonal. This is estimated using moving averages.The part of the series that can’t be attributed to the seasonal or trend components is referred to as residual or error.
